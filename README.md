the car is used to avoid obstacles using ultra sonic sensor mounted on the servo motor 
matreials used:
1---->l298n motor driver
2---->arduino uno r3
3---->hc-sr04 ultra sonic sensor
4---->servo motor
5---->car casis
6---->gear motors
when the car finds a obstacle it basically moves backward for some distance and turn to the side more distance ,also when the car finds a obstacle it rotates its ultra sonic sensor mounted on servo motor to find the least distance on two sidesand tending to turn towards it 
the car turns by keeping high for any one of the motor which is opposite to the direction you are turning .
